# Pullout-coefficient_XGBoost - Instructions
User interface to predict pullout interaction coefficients of geogrid through XGBoost model
## Step 1: Prerequisite:
        Install Python 3.8 or other latest version
        You must have the following libraries: 
          pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, tkinter, and pickle.
## Step 2: Store both the files i.e. Interface.py and xgb_final.pkl in the same folder on downloading.
## Step 3: Prerequisite python libraries to run the program are : 
## Step 4: Run the Interface.py file.

### NOTE: If you are running the .py file from command prompt, please ensure that your command prompt is openend in the folder where the two files (Interface.py and xgb_final.pkl) are stored.
